# Express Note Taker


This program allows the user to create, save, and delete notes. I used Express, the Node.js web application frameworks that allows the use of APIs and web servers. The front end was provided and I focused on connecting the front end to the express background.

Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express

Challenges: This was the first project working with Express.  Understanding the logic to connect the back end to the front end was difficult at the start, specifically planning the file structure, making sure the npm packages were installed, and building the notesActions function in apiRoutes.js. I overcame these challenges by reviewing prior activities using Express servers and stack overflow.
